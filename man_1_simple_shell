.SH NAME
simple_shell - a simple UNIX command interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell

.SH DESCRIPTION
simple_shell is a basic UNIX shell implementation.
It reads commands typed by the user, searches for their executables
in the directories listed in the PATH environment variable,
and executes them in a child process.
If a command cannot be found, it prints an error message and waits
for the next command. The shell loops until the user exits
or an end-of-file (EOF) is reached.

.SH BUILTINS
exit
	Exit the shell.
env
	Print the current environment.

.SH EXAMPLES
Exit the shell :
.PP
$ exit
.PP
Find the full path of a command :
.PP
$ ./find_path
Full path to 'ls' : /bin/ls
