# [**Simple Shell**](https://github.com/laetitiagrondin/holbertonschool-simple_shell)

## 🧠 Description

**Simple Shell** is a minimalist command-line interpreter written in C, inspired by the UNIX `sh` shell.
It can execute both built-in and external commands using a classic read–parse–execute loop.

## 🔧 Compilation

Compile the project with:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
```
---

## ▶️ Usage

Interactive mode

./hsh
$ ls -l
$ echo Hello World
$ env
$ exit
```
Non-interactive mode
```bash
echo "ls" | ./hsh
```

## 🔍 Internal Workflow

Prompt: Display $ and wait for user input.

Read: Capture the input line using getline().

Parse: Split input into tokens using strtok().

Built-in check:

If exit: free memory and quit.

If env: print environment variables and continue.

PATH resolution: Search for executables in directories listed in PATH.

Execute:

Create a new process with fork().

The child executes using execve().

The parent waits for termination with wait().

Loop: Repeat until the user exits or EOF is reached.

## 💡 Built-in Commands

Command	Description
`exit`	Exit the shell
`env`	Display environment variables

---

## 🧹 Memory Management

Frees dynamically allocated memory after every command.

Proper cleanup on exit or end-of-file.

Prevents memory leaks caused by token duplication or getline buffer reuse.
